## mini-project 1: 

This mini-project is about digitizing texts.
We'll learn best practices for scanning a book, and we'll convert the scanned images in computer-readable text in a process called OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Through this process, we'll get our first introduction about Machine Learning.

## mini-project 2:

This mini-project is about studying social media discourse.
I analyzed 1439 comments taken from 110 posts made by 4 public Facebook pages catering to audiences of Gilgit-Baltistan. These posts were selected for their relevance in discourse around a newly instituted land tenure law in Gilgit-Baltistan called to the Gilgit-Baltistan Land Reforms Act 2025. This study investigated whether commenters were using signifiers of colonialism in this discourse.
