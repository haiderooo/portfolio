# It's done (is it really?)

<!--more-->


Digitization project for the book code named Rasail_1940 and titled 'kitāb-i tuḥfatah al-nāẓirīn al-maʿrūf ṣaḥīfah' has been finalized by team Rasail
as part of the Digital Humanities course (2025) at AKU-ISMC's MA Muslim Cultures programme. We scanned and digitized this book written in Persian and published
in 1940 using Escriptorium platform and machine learning models.


In the course of this project we learnt multiple steps of a machine learning OCR based digitization process for a non-latin script text as well as
presentation of the project through a github website. It was demanding for some of us newbies to code and digital processes but it was a whole lot of
learning. Onwards to Mini-Project2!!! Oh, wait, first we shall expect some feedback!
