# It's done (is it really?)

<!--more-->


Digitization project for the book code named Rasail_1940 and titled 'kitāb-i tuḥfatah al-nāẓirīn al-maʿrūf ṣaḥīfah' has been finalized by team Rasail
as part of the Digital Humanities course (2025) at AKU-ISMC's MA Muslim Cultures programme. We scanned and digitized this book written in Persian and published
in 1940 using Escriptorium platform and machine learning models.


[Click here]({{site.baseurl}}Digitization/) to read the extended project description and find all relevant files and references.


In the course of this project we learnt multiple steps of a machine learning OCR based digitization process for a non-latin script text as well as
presentation of the project through a github website. It was demanding for some of us newbies to code and digital processes but it was a whole lot of
learning. Onwards to Mini-Project2!!! Oh, wait, first we shall expect some feedback!
