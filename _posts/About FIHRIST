Union Catalogue of Manuscripts from the Islamicate World

<!--more-->

This is an online catalogue of manuscripts related to Islam present in several libraries around the UK.

It provides the bibliographic information/description of Islamicate manuscripts with a focus on Arabic 
but including a wide variety of languages from around the world.

It is presented online through their FIHRIST website. The website name is more commonly used to refer to the catalogue than its full name.

In light of Druckerâ€™s framework for digital humanities projects, this catalogue engages in 
all three stages including materials, processing and presentation. 
The catalogue uses a mix of digital and non-digital data material to begin with.
However, a large part of the data was in a non-digital form including handlists, historic catalogue entries and annotated card catalogues. 
This data was remediation/mediated through converting/inputting the bibliographic information from the materials into digital TEI/XML files. 
FIHRIST also provides TEI/XML input schemas for contributors, thus decentralizing the contribution process and adding to its sustainability.

Then this information is processed by arrangement within the larger catalogue of FIHRIST itself.
This means assigning appropriate tags, identifiers and categories so that the material is searchable within the keyword, 
languages, classmarks, works, authorship, and subjects among other tags available on FIHRIST.
The presentation of the processed material is delivered through the FIHRIST website which has advanced search engine capabilities.

It not only provides Bibliographic information but also provides links to request material from host libraries offline and online. 

Moreover, the OpenSource approach of this DH project means that they have provided the XML/TEI code on github. 
So it is easily replicable as a system of DH cataloguing for others.

## Formatting

I can add subtitles, like the one above. 

For a new paragraph, I press Enter twice.
If I press Enter only once, the text will be displayed on the same line as the previous one.

Lists are very easy: they can be unordered, like this:

* first item
* another item

If you prefer ordered lists, simply use numbers instead of asterisks:

1. first item
2. a second item
