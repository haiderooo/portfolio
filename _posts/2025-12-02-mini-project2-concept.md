## Topic modelling on social media posts & comments

<!--more-->


This project analyzes public opinion on social media in Gilgit-Baltistan regarding a controversial law pertaining to ownership and control of land in the region. It focuses on the signifier of colonialism in debates on social media surrounding this law. A section of the project will focus on gathering the articulation of response by the social movement organization Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee (GBAAC) and oppositional political leaders who are members of the local legislative body.


# Background


Gilgit-Baltistan is one of the two Pakistan-administered regions under the Kashmir dispute. Amidst long-standing anxieties about resource capture of land by the Pakistani state, a new land tenure law called Gilgit-Baltistan Land Reforms Act 2025 was instituted by the local legislature Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly.1 The aforementioned legislative body faces serious accusations of being controlled more by Islamabad than by local people.2 This Act, while abstractly recognizing the collective ownership of non-private land (e.g. meadows, riverbeds, forests and barren areas etc.), strips the control of that land completely from the local populace. It declares all non-private land, outside of the village boundaries, as ‘impartible’ contradicting the local understanding of it being divided amongst villages, tribes and families. Moreover, the demarcation of the village boundary is not clear, making the Act an instrument of territorialization instead of reform.3


Owing to the lack of constitutional integration of GB in Pakistan and its continued economic and political marginalization, among other reasons, the use of colonialism as signifier has been gaining prevalence over decades.4 This new law has prompted local intellectuals and activists to draw analogies to settler-colonial contexts, especially those of North America. As a result, activists and social movement organizations are expressing resistance and calling for the revoking of the law. The Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee (GBAAC) is the leading broad-based social movement organization of Gilgit-Baltistan which is also leading resistance to the Act.5 


# Subject of research


This research looks at public sentiment in reaction to the GB Land Reforms Act 2025, and the prevalence and articulation of ‘colonialism as signifier’ by activists, the GBAAC and the broader public.


Social media is the primary medium of expression for activists and political organizations, beyond on the ground protest. Moreover, unorganized public opinion is also primarily expressed on social media. This research focuses on statements and comments on social media regarding the Act, specifically on facebook.


# Corpus


For broad based public opinion, the research analyzes comments on public pages including official government pages, pages of political-public figures from the government including legislators who supported the Act, news pages, and pages of the GBAAC. To study the perspective of GBAAC and activists, the research looks at statements of GBAAC and public figure activists.


Specific pages selected for the research are listed below. 

Official government pages:
Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly
Information Department Government of Gilgit-Baltistan

Pages of key legislators who supported and initiated the Act:
Haji Gulbar Khan
Amjad Hussain Advocate

Pages of GBAAC
Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee (Official)

Oppositional legislators:
Nawaz Khan Naji
Kazim Meesum

Social media news pages (comments to news regarding the Act):
Pamir Times
Gilgit-Baltistan Today
Ibex Media Network
Progressive Gilgit-Baltistan

The below table illustrates this categorization of the sources for the corpus of this research.

# Methodology


This research carries out topic modeling on the use and articulation of ‘colonialism as signifier’. The term ‘colonialism’ itself will be supplemented by related words ‘occupation’, ‘dispossession’ and ‘imperialism’. Moreover, the frequency of colonialism and related words as well as their collocations and context of use will be quantified and then analyzed thematically. Note that more than a study of broad public opinion, this research is an analysis of the ways in which Land Reforms Act 2025 has triggered ‘colonialism as signifier’. 

The research will begin by compiling links to all posts from the identified pages and then scrapping the text content of and the comments of these posts. Data will be standardized into UTF-8 text data. Then AI will be used to mine frequency of the use of the word colonialism and locating similar identifiers. The list of terms created through AI will be complemented with additional relevant identifier terms. Finally, posts by oppositional legislators and social movement organizations, and, separately, comments will be analyzed for frequency and contextual use. This will give an analysis of the prevalence and articulation of colonialism as a signifier in response to the Land Reforms Act 2025 among social media users and political actors in Gilgit-Baltistan.

# Challenges and ethical considerations


Social media users from Gilgit-Baltistan post statements and comments in multiple languages including English, Urdu, Burushaski, Wakhi, Khowar, Shina, Balti, Gujjari and Pashto. Urdu is the most prevalently used language. Due to time limitations only English and Urdu comments will be analyzed. Urdu text in both Persian and Latin scripts will be translated into English before use.

This does lead the research to be skewed towards users who have literacy in English and Urdu. Moreover, translation from Urdu to English may lead to loss of contextual meanings.

In terms of ethics, legislators as public figures are not consulted for consent to use their statements. However, only their public statements on their public pages will be collected.
Comments to be analyzed will be anonymized from the beginning by not collecting identifying data including profile names. Moreover, comments by other pages on page posts will not be collected as a measure to avoid bots and fake users. 

This research chose not to include statements and comments of key oppositional political activists such as members of the GBAAC as they face surveillance and this data may lead to further repression and persecution if compromised.
